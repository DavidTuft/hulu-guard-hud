# Legal / Usage Disclaimer

## 1. Scope
This project (“HuluGuard HUD”) is a cosmetic client-side overlay and playback assistant. It:
- Displays a movable / themeable heads-up display (“HUD”) over Hulu’s player.
- Shows timing info, ad episode metrics, session stats, etc.
- Lets the user drag/snap panels, enable Picture-in-Picture HUD, and adjust transparency.
- Prevents accidental scrubbing *backward into* ad blocks that have already fully played.

It does **not**:
- Block, mute, fast-forward, skip, or filter ads.
- Alter streamed content.
- Remove or prevent ad playback.
- Circumvent Hulu subscription tier requirements, paid features, or account restrictions.

This tool does not provide ad-skipping. It only stops the player from rewinding behind the last completed ad boundary and forcing the user to replay an ad pod they already sat through. It is essentially a “don’t jump backward into the ad break you already watched” helper.

## 2. Relationship to Hulu
